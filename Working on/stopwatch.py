#Define your main function: This function will contain the main logic of your stopwatch. You can call it something like stopwatch().

#Initialize your variables: At the start of the stopwatch function, you'll need to initialize some variables. These might include a start time, elapsed time, and a boolean to control the running state of the stopwatch.

#Create a main loop: This will be the main loop for your stopwatch. It will continue running as long as the stopwatch is 'on'.

#Calculate elapsed time: Inside the main loop, calculate the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the current time.

#Handle user input: Also inside the main loop, handle user input to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch. You might use the input() function for this. Depending on the input, you will update your variables.

#Display elapsed time: After handling user input and updating variables, print the elapsed time (or the final time, if the stopwatch was stopped) in a format that's easy to read.

#Call the stopwatch function: Finally, outside of all your function definitions, call your stopwatch() function to start the program.
